# ibetmarkandmajella.com 💍🔥

Ever thought love was a gamble? Welcome to **ibetmarkandmajella.com** — a tongue-in-cheek platform where users place (fake) bets on the long-term fate of Mark and Majella’s relationship. It’s part satire, part social experiment, and all code.

This project showcases my full-stack development skills through a React + Express application that's publicly hosted and fully functional. The humor is optional. The tech is not.

## 🎯 Purpose

- A parody betting website about a real couple’s relationship.
- Built to demonstrate front-end and back-end skills in a fun and creative way.
- Public project designed to entertain, but also to show technical depth and initiative.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React** (via **Vite**) – blazing fast dev experience
- **HTML, JavaScript, CSS** – responsive, no framework bloat
- **Custom UI** – designed for humor, simplicity, and a touch of chaos

### Backend:
- **Node.js + Express** – REST API for bet submissions and leaderboard tracking

### Hosting:
- Deployed live at [ibetmarkandmajella.com](https://ibetmarkandmajella.com)
